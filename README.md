# Molten-Engine

A lightweight, high-performance game engine built on Apple's Metal API using C++ and Objective-C++.  
Designed for macOS, leveraging modern graphics and compute capabilities.

This project is actively evolving as I deepen my understanding of Metal and modern graphics programming.  
Expect frequent updates, improvements, and breaking changes as the engine matures.  

It is very much a work in progress â€” contributions, feedback, and suggestions are highly welcome!

### Features

- Native Metal integration for maximum GPU performance  
- Simple, extensible architecture  
- Cross-language support: C++ core with Objective-C++ Metal integration  
- Example triangle rendering included as a starting point
